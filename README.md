# E-Commerce-Back-End

## About
In the highly competitive world of internet retail, companies need a back-end to ther e-commerce websites that use the latest technologies. This back end will allow a company to track their products by category, price, tag name, product ID and price. This will assist them with tracking their inventory, ordering and projected profits. 

## Technology Used

Used the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect my Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
